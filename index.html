			<p>
				I’m an aspiring Front and Back End Developer who was born in the little island of Trinidad & Tobago known for its asphalt
				and oil refinery. I have obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Information Management Technology. Since 2008 I have been pursuing
				the field of technology in which has become my main career path and a hobby I enjoy a great deal. I also enjoy singing
				in my church choir, reading and meet-up groups.

			</p>
			<p>
				My main goal is to become a Professional Developer and Teacher of Technology for adults and students who are challenged learners
				and who are looking for the opportunity to learn the functionality of this world. Some steps I have taken to fulfill
				my targeted goal have been to join the Rutgers coding boot camp. The boot camp has already given me the skills to build
				a professional website using HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) The material is A++ and
				the code is C-shape. Before that I was focusing on building my database skills and perfecting SQL (Structured Query Language).
				There is a saying, “If you give a man a fish he will be happy for that fish, but, if you teach a man to fish and he will
				be skilled for life and a great contributor to his society”.
